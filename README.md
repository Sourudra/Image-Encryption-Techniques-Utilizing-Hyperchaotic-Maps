# Image-Encryption-Techniques-Utilizing-Hyperchaotic-Maps
Implemented image encryption using 2D and 3D chaotic maps, comparing their efficiency and security. The project explores the strengths of 2D maps for faster encryption and decryption and 3D maps for enhanced protection against attacks. Performance was evaluated using PSNR and SSIM metrics to determine the trade-offs between complexity and security.
