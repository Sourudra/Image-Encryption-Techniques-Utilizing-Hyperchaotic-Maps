# Image-Encryption-Techniques-Utilizing-Hyperchaotic-Maps
Developed an advanced image encryption algorithm in MATLAB, utilizing both 2D and 3D hyperchaotic systems to enhance data security. The project compared the efficiency of 2D chaotic maps, optimized for faster encryption, against 3D chaotic maps, which offer a higher degree of protection due to their complex structure. Chaotic signals were generated and normalized for XOR operations on the imageâ€™s pixel data, ensuring encryption sensitive to initial conditions. The methodology demonstrated robust security, with evaluations using PSNR and SSIM metrics, proving its resilience against attacks and ensuring the protection of sensitive image data.
